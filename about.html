        <h1>Our Story</h1>
   <p>
      Our core team originates from development management and consultancy backgrounds. After building and delivering our own development projects, we bring this experience back into our consultancy work, continuing to do what we do best.
        </p>
      
  <p>
    Our core team has worked together in the same locations before expanding into the international markets where we now maintain offices. This shared foundation ensures strong alignment and a consistent, well-coordinated approach across our services.

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond our consultancy services, Global Reach actively develops and delivers its own property projects across each market in which we operate. This direct involvement spans the full property cycle, from initial market analysis and acquisition through development, management, and exit.
        </p>
         <p>
          By investing our own capital and working through the same challenges faced by our clients, we gain first-hand insight into local regulations, market dynamics, delivery risks, and long-term value creation. These hands-on experiences directly inform our advisory approach.
